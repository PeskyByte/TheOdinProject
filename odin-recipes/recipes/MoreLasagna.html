    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types,[2] made of
      very wide, flat sheets. Either term can also refer to an Italian dish made
      of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as rag√π
      (ground meats and tomato sauce), vegetables, cheeses (which may include
      ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan), and seasonings and spices, like
      Italian seasoning, such as garlic, oregano and basil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted after
      baking. Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and
      then baked in an oven. The resulting baked pasta is cut into
      single-serving square portions./p>
